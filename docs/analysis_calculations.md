*Calculations* are a powerful tool in SENAITE to define *Analysis Services* that
take no manual input, but are calculated out of either user-defined parameters 
(*Interim fields*) or Results of other Analyses.

During this guide we created an *Analysis Service* for `Total Hardness`.
However, we did not specify a calculation so far, but would like to be it a sum
of the Results from the `Calcium` and `Magnesium` Analyses.

### Add Calculations

Navigate to the *LIMS Setup* by clicking the ‚öôÔ∏è button in the upper right corner
and then on the *Calculations* tile.

![Add Calculation](/screenshots/add_calculation_screen.png "Add Calculation")

Enter the following values in the add form:

- Title: `Total Hardness`
- Description: `Calculate the total hardness of Water based on the Calcium and Magnesium Results`
- Calculation Formula `[Ca] + [Mg]`

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
You can use any valid [Python Expression][Python Expressions] in the
*Calculation Formula*

Click the *Save* button when you are done.

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
The calculation formula references the *Keywords* of the *Analysis Services* we
defined in the [Quickstart](quickstart#add-analysis-services) section earlier.
Selecting a meaningful *Analysis Service Keyword* is therefore from absolute
importance, since changing it later will break existing *Calculations*!

**ü§ì Pro-Tip:**
Calculations also understand a selected set of [Python Builtins][Python Builtins]
like `min`, `max`, `round`, `pow` etc.


## Using the calculation in an Analysis Service

Next we need to hook the calculation to the *Analysis Service*. Navigate to the
*LIMS Setup* and chose the *Analysis Services* tile. Select the `Total Hardness`
service from the listing and click on the *Edit* tab.

![Analysis Service Calculation](/screenshots/analysis_service_calculation.png "Analysis Service Calculation")

Navigate to the *Method* tab and deselect the option *Use the Default
Calculation of Method*. The *Calculation* selection should then be automatically
filled with our new created calculation. Press the *Save* button when you are
done.


## Applying an Analysis with a Calculation to a Sample

As already mentioned in the [Sample Analyses](sample-analyses) section, our
change in the *Analysis Service* for `Total Hardness` does *not* affect any
existing Analyses in our Samples.

Consequently, we must either create a new Sample with the `Total Hardness`
Analysis, e.g. by copying an existing one, or remove and re-add this Analysis
from an existing Sample .

Here we are going to create a new Sample by copying an existing one and save the
copied values without any changes and receive it afterwards.

![Sample with Calculation](/screenshots/sample_with_calculation.png "Sample with Calculation")

The *Manage Results* listing looks almost similar to the previous ones, but has
the Results field of the `Total Hardness` Analysis greyed out, so that you can
not introduce their a manual result anymore.

However, the `Calcium` and `Magnesium` Analyses still take manual Results and we
can test our *Calculation* by entering the following values for them:

- Calcium: `9.1`
- Magnesium: `9.5`

Since we defined the formula as `[Ca] + [Mg]`, we expect for the `Total
Hardness` a Result of `18.6`.

![Sample with Calculation](/screenshots/sample_with_calculation_calculated.png "Sample with Calculation")

The *Calculation* for `Total Hardness` got executed after both dependent
Analyses were saved and the final Result was marked for submission
automatically.


## Calculation Versioning

The same behavior like for *Analysis Services* applies also for *Calculations*,
so that changes in the Calculation does *not* affect any of the Analysis created
with prior versions of the Calculation.

To demonstrate this, we are going to change the Formula of our `Total Hardness`
Calculation and introduce a new parameter (*Interim*) to our formula:

Navigate to the *LIMS Setup* and edit the prior created Calculation to enter the
following values:

- Calculation Interim Fields:
  - Keyword: `factor`
  - Title: `Factor`
  - Default value: `1`
- Calculation Formula: `([Ca] + [Mg]) * [factor]`

Press the *Save* button when you are done.

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
User-defined parameters (*Interim fields*) also introduce Keywords that can be 
referenced in Calculation Formulas like the keywords of *Analysis Services*. 
Thus, they are checked for uniqueness in the system.

Navigate back to the prior created Sample and click on the blue üõà Button next to
the `Total Hardness` Analysis to view the details of the Analysis.

![Analysis Details](/screenshots/analysis_popup.png "Analysis Popup")

As you can see in the *Calculation* section of the displayed popup, the formula
still references the initial version (`[Ca] + [Mg]`) and it has not been changed
for this Sample. This mechanism ensures pre-existing tests won't change, even
after modifying the electronic records they are based on. Therefore, this
guarantees the integrity of the data, that is required for compliance with 
ISO 17025.

However, creating a copy of this Sample uses the new Formula.

![Sample with Calculation and Interim](/screenshots/sample_with_calculation_and_interim.png "Sample with Calculation and Interim")

The new created Sample displays now also the calculation parameter (*Interim 
field*) we introduced earlier. Clicking again on the blue üõà Button next to the
`Total Hardness` Analysis reveals the new version of the Calculation with the 
new Formula `([Ca] + [Mg] * [factor]`.

## External Calculations

Using [Python Expressions][Python Expressions] and [Python Builtins][Python
Builtins] inside might be sometimes not enough for your Calculation and you need
to do more complex numeric computations.

The SENAITE Calculation machinery let you therefore import your own modules with
external functions to even use external libraries like [SciPy][SciPy] or
[NumPy][NumPy].

Create a file called `calculations.py` and put it somewhere in the `PYTHONPATH`
on your SENAITE Server. For simplicity, we simply put it directly into the
`site-packages` directory of the used Python interpreter.

Use this command to find out where the `site-packages` directory is located on
your server: `python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages())"`

Add the following contents into `calculations.py`:

```python
def total_hardness(a, b, factor=1):
   return float(a + b) * factor
```

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
You need to restart your SENAITE instances for this new module to be imported!

Navigate to the prior created calculation and enter the following values:

- Additional Python Libraries:
  - Module: `calculations`
  - Function: `total_hardness`
- Calculation Formula `total_hardness([Ca], [Mg], factor=[factor])`

![Calculation with external Module](/screenshots/calculation_with_external_module.png "Calculation with external Module")

Copy now one of the previous Samples to a new one to use the new *Calculation
Formula*. Also receive the Sample to be able to introduce new Results.

Click again on the blue üõà Button next to the `Total Hardness` Analysis to verify
that the new Formula is set to `total_hardness([Ca], [Mg], factor=[factor])`.

![Analysis Details](/screenshots/analysis_popup_3.png "Analysis Popup")

Introduce now some Results for `Calcium`, `Magnesium` and the `Factor` parameter.

Congratulations üôå you successfully created your first Calculation in SENAITE
and learned how to import external modules for complex computations.
