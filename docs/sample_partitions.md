Samples can be splitted into Partitions (Aliquots), so that specific analyses
can be conducted on each Partition individually.

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
Each Partition acts like a normal Sample and also follows the [same
Workflow](sample-basics#sample-workflow) as the other Samples.

In this section we extend our given setup to mimic a laboratory with two
departments, one for `Water Chemistry` and one for `Microbiology`.
Since these two departments are located physically in different buildings,
we need to partition the incoming Water samples into two Aliquots.


## Preparing the LIMS

First we add a new *Lab Department* in the *LIMS Setup*.

Enter the following values in the add form:

- Title: `Microbiology`
- Description: `Micro-Biological analysis`

Please revisit the [Quickstart section](quickstart#add-lab-departments) how to
add lab departments.

Next we add a new *Analysis Category* in the *LIMS Setup*.

Enter the following values in the add form:

- Title: `Microbiology`
- Description: `Micro-Biological analyses grouped together`
- Department: `Microbiology`

Please revisit the [Quickstart section](quickstart#add-analysis-categories) how
to add analysis categories.

Finally, we add a new *Analysis Service*.

Enter the following values in the add form:

- Title: `Salmonella`
- Analysis Keyword: `Salmon`
- Point of Capture: `Lab`
- Analysis Category: `Microbiology`
- Department `Microbiology`

Please revisit the [Quickstart section](quickstart#add-analysis-services) how
to add analysis services.


## Creating Sample Partitions

Now it is time to create a new Sample for partitioning.

Please revisit the [Quickstart section](quickstart#add-new-samples) how
to add new samples.

Enter the following values in the add form:

- Contact: `Rita Mohale`
- Date Sampled: Click the `now` button in the calendar popup to choose the
  current date and time
- Sample Type: `Water`
- Lab Analyses: Select `Calcium`, `Magnesium`, `Total Hardness` and `Salmonella`

Also make sure to receive the sample after creation by selecting it in the list
and press the *Receive* button.

Now select the new created Sample and click on the *Create Partitions* Button
to open the partitioning view.

Please select first the number of Partitions to create, in our case `2` and
press the *Preview* button.

Select now the `Calcium`, `Magnesium` and `Total Hardness` Analyses for the
first Partition, and `Salmonella` for the second Partition.

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
There are some options you can apply for each partition differently: 
*Internal use*, *Sample Type*, *Container* and *Preservation*. When *Internal Use* 
checkbox is selected, the partition won't be visible to client contacts with 
granted access to the system. The partition and its analyses won't be displayed 
in results reports neither.

Click the *Create Partitions* button when you are done.

![Create Partitions](/screenshots/sample_create_partitions_saved.png "Create Partitions")

A little black triangle appears now in the Samples listing next to our partitioned Sample.
Click on it to expand and view the created partitions.

Note that by default, the partitions keep the id of the parent sample, followed
by a `-P` (from *Partition*) and the number of partition. The ID format for
partitions, as well as for other electronic records, can be changed in LIMS
Setup to fit better the lab needs. The ID Formatting machinery will be introduced
later in this documentation.


## Introducing Results in Partitions

Introducing results to partitions works the same like in all other Samples, see the
[Sample Basics section](sample-basics#enter-results) to recap how to enter results.

However, the key difference is, that Partitions propagate the analysis results
to their parent Sample.

Let's enter the same results as we did before to our first Partition. Click on
the link for the first Sample (the one ending with `-P01`) and enter some results.

![Manage Partition Results](/screenshots/sample_manage_partition_results_saved.png "Manage Partition Results")

Click the *Save* and then the *Submit* Button when you are done.

Now click on the generated link in the blue info box to navigate to the parent
Sample.

![Partition Alert Box](/screenshots/sample_alert_box_partition.png "Partition Alert Box")

The entered results will be displayed on the parent Sample as well.

![Manage Partition Results](/screenshots/sample_manage_partition_results_root.png "Manage Partition Results")

Now we are going to verify the submitted results on the parent Sample.

![Verify Partition Results](/screenshots/sample_verify_partition_results_root.png "Verify Partition Results")

Navigating back to the first Partition shows that also this operation was correctly propagated back.

![Verify Partition Results](/screenshots/sample_verify_partition_results_verified.png "Verify Partition Results")


**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
The status of the parent sample will automatically follow the status of its 
partitions, but only if the analyses that were initially assigned to the parent 
sample are all them later distributed across partitions. This means that you 
could create partitions from a given sample with their own analyses each, at the
same time you keep some analyses bound to the primary.


## Detaching Partitions

As we've seen before, parent samples follows the status of their partitions and
analyses from partitions are always displayed in the parent sample. Sometimes
this is not the desired behavior, e.g. you might want to keep a partition stored
in the laboratory without having any effect to the rest. In such cases, you can 
make use of the action *Detach*.

Go to the samples listing and select the second partition (the one ending with
`-P02`) and press the button *Detach*.


In Samples listing, the detached partition is no longer displayed under its 
parent, rather is displayed as if it was a primary sample. If you click to the
little black triangle next to the original sample you will notice that only the
first partition is displayed below.

Detached partitions become "primary" samples and no longer depend on (or 
propagate to) their original parent sample, but their relationship is kept 
in the system. Click to the detached partition.

A blue box is displayed at the top with the link to the original sample the
current sample was originated from.
  

Congratulations üôå you successfully learned how to create Partitions in SENAITE.
