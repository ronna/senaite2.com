*Calculations* are a powerful tool in SENAITE to define *Analysis Services* that
take no manual input, but are calculated out of the Results of other Analyses
Results.

During this guide we created an *Analysis Service* for `Total Hardness`. However, we did
not specify a calculation so far, but would like to be it a sum of the Results
from the `Calcium` and `Magnesium` Analyses.

### Add Calculations

Navigate to the *LIMS Setup* by clicking the ⚙️ button in the upper right corner
and then on the *Calculations* tile.
