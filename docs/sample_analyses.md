Analyses define the tests to be conducted on a Sample and are basically clones
of *Analysis Services*.

In the section [Quickstart into SENAITE](quickstart#add-analysis-services) you
created *Analysis Services* for `Calcium`, `Magnesium` and `Total Hardness` and
added them later to your [first Sample](quickstart#add-new-samples).

However, the *Analysis Service* acts just like a *template* for *Analyses*, that
were actually added during Sample creation.
Consequently, changing the *Analysis Service* at a later point will not change
any Analyses already contained in Samples.


## Manage Analyses in Samples

After a Sample is registered in the system it contains at least one Analysis.
