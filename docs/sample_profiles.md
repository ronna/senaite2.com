In the previous sections you added single Analyses for each Sample which can
become difficult to manage when there are numerous *Analysis Services* in the
system. Also some labs provide package prices on tests that encompass several
Analyses instead of pricing them individually.

SENAITE provides *Analysis Profiles* for this purpose to simplify the creation
process of new created Samples. Think of *Analysis Profiles* like a "Recipe" or
a "Makefile" that defines the *Analyses* to be added.
