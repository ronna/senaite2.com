## Introduction

Before starting laboratory routine work on SENAITE, [baseline content types] 
need to be created first, such as clients, departments, analyses services, etc.
Some baseline objects might depend on others (for instance, department objects
need to be created before being able to create analyses services) and therefore,
is required to create the objects in a given order. 

Login to SENAITE with a user belonging to "LabManagers" group and follow the
sections below to setup the baseline data.
