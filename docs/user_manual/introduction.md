SENAITE LIMS is a web-based and Open Source Laboratory Information Management 
System (LIMS) for enterprise environments. It is an impressive but user-friendly
software system, designed to make laboratory data management easy and efficient. 

Compared to other enterprise-scale systems, it offers unmatched flexibility.
Being Open Source and built on top of the trusted and industry-proven 
[Zope](https://www.zope.org) and [Plone](https://plone.com/about.html) 
frameworks, SENAITE LIMS can be customized to fit your laboratory needs 
yet providing robustness and high security standards.

SENAITE LIMS capabilities and features can be extended easily with ready-to-use 
add-ons specifically designed for SENAITE: sample storage capabilities, panic 
and life-threatening conditions alerts, additional features for health-care 
laboratories and many more.

Other corporate software can be integrated easily with SENAITE for data exchange
and extraction thanks to either the powerful [RESTFul JSON API](https://github.com/senaite/senaite.jsonapi) 
or by using its multi-plexer functionality.

Although SENAITE LIMS might seem overwhelming at the beginning, as you become 
more familiar with the features it provides, less time and effort is needed 
to accomplish your everyday lab practices.
