## Overview

Welcome to the User Manual of SENAITE LIMS, an Open Source Laboratory Information
Management System (LIMS) for enterprise environments.


## Scope and Intended Audience

This manual is meant to be a complete description of the functionalities 
provided with SENAITE LIMS, and is intended as an introduction to the software 
for laboratory personnel. Although is not possible to consider all use-cases and
scenarios that different laboratory disciplines might require when implementing
or using a LIMS, some examples for most common use cases have been included in 
order to help the reader on the design of their own solution and/or approach.

The intended audience of this document is laboratory personnel that use or is
planning to use SENAITE LIMS as their Laboratory Information Management System.
Readers are not required to be Lab managers or have deep knowledge on how to
operate a laboratory. However, some knowledge about analytical methods and
procedures would be advantageous for reading of this document. 

In some chapters, the reader will find contents that might require technical 
background about the technologies the software is based on. These contents are 
meant to merely help the reader to understand how and why SENAITE LIMS works the
way it does, but the reader can skip them and jump to more functional-related 
topics without losing sight. Readers more inclined to know about the internals
of SENAITE and technologies behind can visit the links provided are encouraged to
visit the technical documentation of SENAITE add-ons.


## How to read this manual

This manual is more explanatory and verbose in nature than the technical 
documentation of SENAITE add-ons. Some things to bear in mind while reading this
document:

* This manual is not and does not try to be an exhaustive documentation of
  every possible use-case, scenario and/or laboratory operation that can be 
  modelled in SENAITE LIMS or for which SENAITE LIMS can be used.
  
* Use cases and examples presented in this manual are influenced by ongoing
  deployments and SENAITE users feedback. If an example or explanation seems to 
  be inconsistent with existing technical documentation for SENAITE or related 
  add-ons, this may be a genuine error, but it could also be a reflection of 
  potential or upcoming changes to SENAITE LIMS.
  
* Every effort has been made to ensure that all the information contained in 
  this document is correct. However, authors reserve the right to make any
  changes necessary without notice as part of ongoing product development.


## About SENAITE LIMS

SENAITE LIMS is a robust, web-based and Open Source Laboratory Information 
Management System (LIMS) for enterprise environments, especially focused to 
behave with excellent performance and stability. SENAITE LIMS is part of a 
family of inter-related Open Source software applications and add-ons that are 
developed and published under the umbrella of SENAITE name. These add-ons, and 
SENAITE LIMS as well, are hosted in the [SENAITE's organization Github page](https://github.com/senaite).

The main point of Open Source software is providing open and unrestricted access
to the program source code, so organizations using SENAITE can access, study and
modify the software in order to make the software better fit with their own 
organizational needs. Also, organizations can benefit from improvements and 
other developments made world-wide by companies supporting SENAITE and by the
[SENAITE Open Source Community](https://community.senaite.org).

SENAITE is maintained, developed and backed-up by
[Naralabs](https://naralabs.com) and [Riding Bytes](https://ridingbytes.com), 
since November 2017. 

The first public version of SENAITE LIMS, 1.2.0, was released on Jan 3d, 2018. 
By the end of year 2020, more than ten versions have  been released publicly and
the system has been implemented in many laboratories worldwide.

All active work is publicly available and visible on Github and undergoes 
thorough code reviews and testing before new releases are made public.
