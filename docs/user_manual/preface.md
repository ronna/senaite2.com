Welcome to the User Manual of SENAITE LIMS, an Open Source Laboratory Information
Management System (LIMS) for enterprise environments.

## Scope and Intended Audience

Although is not possible to consider all possible use-cases and scenarios that
different laboratory disciplines might require when implementing or using a 
LIMS, some examples for most common use cases have been included in order to 
help the reader on the design of their own solution.

The intended audience of this document is laboratory personnel that use or is
planning to use SENAITE LIMS as their Laboratory Information Management System.
Readers are not required to be Lab managers or have deep knowledge on how to
operate a laboratory. However, some knowledge about analytical methods and
techniques would be advantageous for reading of this document.


## About SENAITE LIMS

can benefit from improvements and other developments made world-wide by
companies supporting SENAITE and by the [SENAITE Open Source Community](https://community.senaite.org).
