Many labs usually process similar Samples of a specific Sample Type for a
certain Client and it becomes tedious to create these Samples always from
scratch. This is where the Sample Copy come in handy.


## Copy a single Sample

In the previous section you successfully created and published your first
Sample. Now we are going to duplicate that Sample for that Client.

Navigate to the *Samples* tab of your client and activate the *All* filter of
the Samples listing table. Select the published Sample from before and click on
the *Copy to new* button at the bottom of the page.

**☝️Note:**
The Sample listing table initially load with the *Active* filter set. This
filter shows only Samples until the Workflow State *Verified*, but not the
*Published* ones.

The Sample Add form opens again with all the settings copied from the first
Sample and giving you the chance to adapt the settings for the copied Sample.

We are going to leave the values as they are and proceed with clicking the
*Save* button.

The new Sample was created with the next generated ID for the selected Sample Type.


## Copy multiple Samples

It is also possible to copy multiple Samples at once and even Samples from
different Clients.
