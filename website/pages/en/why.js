            Choosing Open Source is a matter of <strong>liberty</strong> and not just the ability to get the software for free.
            We believe that <strong>freedom is one of the most important goods</strong> in every aspect of life.
            Therefore, you should choose SENAITE primarily because of its abilities and because you love your freedom as much as we do.
