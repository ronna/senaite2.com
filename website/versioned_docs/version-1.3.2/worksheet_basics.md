In the previous sections you learned about Samples and how to enter Results for
the Analyses on a per-Sample basis. This approach might get quickly tedious and
error prone for Analysts who are just measuring one specific Analysis on
their instrument and need to enter the results in the right samples.

This is where *Worksheets* come in and simplify the results capturing for
Analysts to handle Analyses of the same type together in a spreadsheet-like
listing.


## Creating Worksheets

Navigate in the menu to *Worksheets* to see all open Worksheets in SENAITE.

![Worksheets Listing](/screenshots/worksheets_listing.png "Worksheets Listing")

Currently we have no *Worksheets* in our system. However, we cannot create
Worksheets without an Analyst assigned. Since we did not create any Analysts
yet, we need to do that first.

### Creating an Analyst

Navigate to the *LIMS Setup* by clicking the ‚öôÔ∏è button in the upper right corner
and then on the *Lab Contacts* tile. Click on the ‚äï Add Button to create a new
Lab Contact.

![Add Lab Contact](/screenshots/add_lab_contact_analyst.png "Add Lab Contact")

Enter the following values in the add form:

- Firstname: `Lab`
- Lastname: `Analyst 1`
- Departments: Select all departments
- Email Address: `analyst1@example.com`

Click the *Save* button when you are done.

Now click on the *Login Detail* tab and create a new user with the following details:

- User Name: `analyst1`
- Password: `analyst1`
- Email: `analyst1@example.com`
- Group: Select the `Analysts` group

Click the *Save* button when you are done.

The lab contact is now linked to a user with the Analyst role granted.

![Add Lab Contact](/screenshots/add_lab_contact_analyst2.png "Add Lab Contact")

Navigate now back to the *Worksheets* listing.

### Adding a Worksheet

Select the previously created Analyst `analyst1` from the drop-down menu and
click the *Add* button to create a new worksheet.

![Add Worksheet](/screenshots/worksheet_add.png "Add Worksheet")

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
When you do not see the previously created `analyst1` user, this is because
SENAITE caches the users list internally for one hour. You can either wait or
restart your instance to flush the cache immediately.

![Worksheet Add Analyses](/screenshots/worksheet_add_analyses.png "Worksheet Add Analyses")

After the *Worksheet* was created, all open and unassigned Analyses are listed.
This means that only Analyses are shown, which have not been added yet in another
*Worksheet* or are already submitted for verification (or in a later state).

Let's assume that we want our Analyst to enter results for `Salmonella` test.
Search for the Term `Salmonella` and press enter.

**ü§ì Pro-Tip:**
Use the filter functionality in listings in combination with the column sorting
by clicking on the column you want to sort. This makes it easier to select the
right Analyses in the listing.

![Worksheet Add Analyses](/screenshots/worksheet_add_analyses_salmonella.png "Worksheet Add Analyses")

In the filtered list, select all `Salmonella` Analyses and press the *Assign* button.

![Worksheet Classic View](/screenshots/worksheet_add_analyses_saved.png "Worksheet Classic View")

The *Worksheet* lists now the selected Analyses in a spreadsheet-like table
where all results can be added at once.


### Changing the layout of a Worksheet

Initially all Worksheets show the *Classic*, which lists all assigned Analyses
by Sample. However, some labs prefer to have the them listed by Analysis, which
can be done by changing the Layout to *Transposed*.

![Worksheet Transposed View](/screenshots/worksheet_transposed.png "Worksheet Transposed View")

The default layout for Worksheets can also be permanently changed in the *LIMS
Setup* in the section *Appearance*. Select the preferred layout and save the changes.

![Setup Worksheet layout](/screenshots/setup_appearance_worksheet_layout.png "Setup Worksheet layout")


### Adding Results to a Worksheet

We assigned the *Worksheet* to our previously created Analyst `Lab Analyst 1`.
Let's login with this user to introduce results to our Worksheet.

Please logout with the current user or open another Browser to login as
`analyst1`. Open now the *Worksheet* and introduce some results.

![Worksheet Results](/screenshots/worksheet_analyst_results.png "Worksheet Results")

After the results have been saved and submitted, the Analyst can not do any more changes.

Now login again as Admin (or a user with the role of a *Lab Manager*) to verify
the submitted results.

Congratulations üôå you successfully created your first Worksheet in SENAITE
and learned how to change the layout.
