Samples are usually sent in Containers to the lab and need to be identified with
the electronic record in SENAITE on arrival. To support that identification 
process, SENAITE provides an easy and customizable way to print Barcodes for 
Analysis Requests, Batches, Worksheets etc.


## Generate a Barcode for a Sample

In the previous section you copied several new Samples. Now we are going to
print a Barcode for them to label the Samples and identify and find them quickly
in SENAITE.

Navigate to the *Samples* tab of your client and activate the *Active* filter of
the Samples listing table. Select one of the registered Sample from before and
click on the *Print Stickers* button at the bottom of the page.

This opens the Barcode Print Preview where a Barcode Template and the number of
Copies can be selected.

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
The *Print* button will generate a PDF of the selected Barcode with the given
dimensions. The PDF can then be printed via the Print Dialog of your Operating
System (usually triggered by the keys `Ctrl+P`), which need to be configured
properly to match the dimensions of your Sticker Printer.
At this point it can not be controlled anymore from SENAITE how your Printer
will match the dimensions and the placement of the generated Barcode.

**ü§ì Pro-Tip:**
You can easily customize the existing stickers (or create your own) [direcly in
the codebase of SENAITE][SENAITE_stickers]. However, it is always recommended to
do such customizations in a separate Add-on to prevent your changes from being
lost when updating the core codebase of SENAITE.

Barcodes can also be generated directly from within a Sample. Open a Sample from
the Samples listing by clicking on the generated *Sample ID* link. Make sure you
are on the *View* tab and click on the rightmost barcode icon below the workflow
menu to open the Barcode Print Preview.

The other two Barcode Buttons are a short cut to print the configured small or
large Barcode directly.


## Generate Barcodes for multiple Samples

You can als easily print barcodes for multiple Samples. Navigate to the Sample
listing and select two or more Samples from the listing table.

Clicking on the *Print Stickers* button opens again the Barcode Print Preview,
but this time for both of the selected Samples.

Pressing the *Print* button generates the barcodes for the selected Samples.

## Autogenerate Barcodes on Sample Reception

The printing of Barcodes can be automated when Samples are registered or
received. The setting can be enabled in the *Sticker* section of the *LIMS
Setup*, as well as the standard templates for the small and large Barcodes.

Click on the ‚öôÔ∏èbutton in the upper right corner and choose the grey *Setup* tile
to open the general Setup options. Select the *Sticker* tab and chose *Receive*
from the *Automatic sticker printing* menu. Press save when you are done.

The Barcode Print Preview opens now automatically when you receive a Sample.


## Locating a Sample when scanning the Barcode

The generated Barcodes contain the generated *Sample ID* which is unique in
SENAITE. Therefore, scanning the barcode will reveal this *Sample ID* and put it
usually on the place where the cursor is placed.

To streamline the process of scanning and locating a scanned barcode, SENAITE
provides the *Spotlight Search*, which can be triggered with the keys `Ctrl+Space`.

![Spotlight Search](/screenshots/senaite_spotlight_search.png "Spotlight Search")

The *Spotlight Search* can be executed at any place in SENAITE and always places
the cursor directly in the search field.

We simulate now the scanning of a sample by putting in directly the *Sample ID*
of one of the generated barcodes.

![Spotlight Search](/screenshots/senaite_spotlight_search_barcode.png "Spotlight Search")

Navigate with the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys of your keyboard to select a
search result and press `Enter` to navigate to this item.

**ü§ì Pro-Tip:**
If the item you searched appears at the top of the *Spotlight Search*, you can
press immediately `Enter` to select and navigate in one step.


Congratulations üôå you successfully printed barcodes for your Samples and
located them quickly with the *Spotlight Search*.
