*Analysis Services* can be categorized to be better manageable and sortable.
In the previous sections you created already categories for `Water Chemistry`
and `Microbiology`.

However, we did not activate yet the categorization, so all Analysis Services
appeared ungrouped in the listings.


## Activate Analysis Categorization

Click on the ‚öôÔ∏èbutton in the upper right corner and choose the *Setup* tile.
Navigate to the *Analyses* tab and activate the checkbox *Categorise analysis
services* and press the *Save* button afterwards.

Move now back to the *Analysis Services* listing and see how the Analyses
Services are grouped together *Water Chemistry*. By default the Category rows
appear collapsed, but clicking on it expands the group.

## Sorting Categories

*Analysis Categories* are per default sorted alphabetically. However, you may
also define a *Sort Key* to override the default sorting behavior.

Per default the category `Microbiology` appears *before* `Water Chemistry`.

Now we are going to add a *Sort Key* to the `Water Chemistry` category by
navigating to the *Edit* tab of this category and put the `100` as *SortKey*.

Navigate now back to the *Aanlysis Services* listing to verify the result.

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
The *Sort Key* is a floatable number that get *prepended* to the category name,
e.g. `100.0Water_Chemistry`. Consequently, categories with *Sort key* will be
always listed *before* categories with no *Sort Key* set.

Congratulations üôå you successfully learned how to categorize *Analysis
Services* and how to use the *Sort Key* to override the sort order of the
categories.
