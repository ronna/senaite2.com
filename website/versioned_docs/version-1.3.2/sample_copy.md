Many labs usually process similar Samples of a specific Sample Type for a
certain Client and it becomes tedious to create these Samples always from
scratch. This is where the Sample Copy come in handy.


## Copy a single Sample

In the previous section you successfully created and published your first
Sample. Now we are going to duplicate that Sample for that Client.

Navigate to the *Samples* tab of your client and activate the *All* filter of
the Samples listing table. Select the published Sample from before and click on
the *Copy to new* button at the bottom of the page.

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
The Sample listing table initially load with the *Active* filter set. This
filter shows only Samples until the Workflow State *Verified*, but not the
*Published* ones.

The Sample Add form opens again with all the settings copied from the first
Sample and giving you the chance to adapt the settings for the copied Sample.

We are going to leave the values as they are and proceed with clicking the
*Save* button.

The new Sample was created with the next generated ID for the selected Sample Type.


## Copy multiple Samples

It is also possible to copy multiple Samples at once and even Samples from
different Clients.

Make sure you are still on the *Samples* tab of your Client and that you have
selected the *All* filter of the listing table. Select now both samples.

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
The buttons at the bottom of each listing table appear first when you selected
one or more items from the table. The displayed number in the buttons refers to
the selected items of the table.

Click on the *Copy to new* button to create a copy of the selected Samples.

![Client Samples Add](/screenshots/client_add_samples_screen.png "Client Samples Add")

The Add form shows now two columns which hold the copied values from the samples.

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
The order how the Sample columns appear in that listing correspond to the order
of the listing table where you selected the Samples.

Click on the *Save* button to copy the two Samples.
