In the previous guide you created your first sample in SENAITE. Next we are
going to learn the basics about the standard sample workflow, how to process a
sample through the states of the sample workflow and how to publish a sample
report and send it to the Client Contact.


## Sample Workflow

Each entity in SENAITE follows a workflow which defines *Transitions* and
*States*. You can think of a workflow like a directed graph with nodes and edges,
where a node represents a State and the connecting edge reflects a Transition.

The basic workflow of a sample can thus be displayed as follows:

```text
Registered -> Sample Due -> Received -> To be verified -> Verified -> Published
          \  /          \  /        \  /              \  /        \  /
       initialze      receive      submit            verify      publish
```

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
This is graph omits some additional Sample states/transitions for the sake of 
simplicity. Permissions, visibility constraints and available actions for a 
given sample will depend on its workflow state.


### Receive the Sample

You have already seen the first *State* of the prior created *Sample*, which was
`Sample due`. In this state it is *not possible to enter any results*, because the
sample has not been received yet by the lab. 

The reception of the sample is usually done by a laboratory clerk and involves 
a full review of the sample conditions to ensure its validity (the support is 
not broken, suitability of the preservation, the sample type fits with the 
requirements of the requested analyses, the elapsed time since the sample was 
collected is in range, etc.). Therefore, the process of sample reception is a 
critical step in contract-analyses labs. For non-contract-analysis labs (those 
that create and consume their own samples), this process can be performed 
automatically by turning on the setting "Auto-receive samples" in LIMS Setup.  

To receive a sample, you can select the *Receive* transition from the dropdown
menu within the Sample.

![Receive Sample](/screenshots/transition_receive_sample.png "Receive Sample")

Alternatively, it is also possible to select the Sample from the Samples Listing
view and click on the *Receive* button at the bottom.

![Receive Samples](/screenshots/transition_receive_samples.png "Receive Samples")

After you executed one of the two possibilities, the Sample is in the state *Received*.

![Sample Received](/screenshots/sample_received.png "Sample Received")

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
The colored borders in the listings also encode the state of the items,
where yellow stands for `Sample due`, brown for `Sample received`, turquoise for
`To be verified`, blue for `Verified` and green for `Published`.


### Enter Results 

Only in the *Received* state a user with the `Analyst` role can introduce the 
measured results for the Analyses of the Sample.

Logout from the system by clicking the *Log out* button displayed in the blue 
dropdown list at top-right with title *Lab Manager*. Login with the credentials 
for the user with *Analyst* role you created in the section 
[*Add a Laboratory Analyst* from the previous guide](quickstart#add-a-laboratory-analyst):

- User Name: `analyst`
- Password: `analyst`

Once logged in, note that *Lab Analyst* is displayed now in the blue box at 
top-right corner.

Open the previously created sample by clicking on the generated 
link in the samples listing, which automatically opens the *Manage Results* tab 
for you.

![Manage Results](/screenshots/sample_manage_results.png "Sample Manage Results")

You can now enter the results for each Analysis in the *Lab Analyses* listing.

Press the *Save* button when you are done to introduce the numbers to the server.

After the results were saved, they can be submitted.

![Manage Results](/screenshots/sample_manage_results_saved.png "Sample Manage Results")

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
The intermediate *Save* step does not submit the results for verification yet,
but is used to trigger server side logic like e.g. calculations or range
specifications. As soon as the results are submitted, the Analyst can not change
the values anymore and the State of the Sample is *To be verified*

![Manage Results](/screenshots/sample_manage_results_submitted.png "Sample Manage Results")

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
Here we've entered the results directly in the Sample view, but, as we will see
in [Working with Worksheets](worksheet-basics) guide, the management and 
distribution of the work to be done within laboratory analysts, along with the 
results entry, will mostly be performed by using Worksheets. 


### Verify the submitted Results

Only users with the role of a `Lab Manager` or `Verifier` are allowed to
*Verify* the results of a Sample by selecting the Analyses and click on the
*Verify* button.

The verification of results is maybe the most important step within the whole
process. This step involves the review of both the sample information and the 
results submitted by the analyst. Once an analysis is verified, the client 
contact with access granted to the system will be able to see the result, 
even if is not yet published. There is no step-back option once an analysis has
been verified by a qualified user other than invalidating the whole sample.

Logout from the system and login again with the credentials for the user you
created in the previous guide that belongs to the "Lab Manager" role:

- User Name: `labman`
- Password: `labman`

Once logged in, go back to the created Sample and select all submitted Analyses. 
The button to verify the results appears now.

![Verify Sample Results](/screenshots/sample_verify_results.png "Verify Sample Results")

Clicking on the *Verify* button verifies the results.

![Verified Sample Results](/screenshots/sample_verified_results.png "Verified Sample Results")

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
In this guide we are verifying the results directly in Sample's manage analyses 
view. As we will see later in [Working with Worksheets](worksheet-basics) guide, 
the addition of QC analyses (controls, blanks and duplicates) to ensure the 
quality of the tests and provide useful insights for the verification process 
can be done with Worksheets.


### Publish the Results

To finalize the Sample, it needs to be transitioned to the *Published* state (or
another end-state). Only users with the role of a `Lab Manager` or a `Publisher`
are allowed to publish the sample.

Navigate to the sample view and select the *Publish* transition from the upper
right workflow dropdown.

![Publish Sample Results](/screenshots/sample_publish_results.png "Publish Sample Results")

This opens the PDF printing preview of [SENAITE Impress][SENAITE-impress], where
the report template, paper format, orientation and custom report options can be
selected.

![Sample Publish Preview](/screenshots/sample_publish_preview.png "Sample Publish Preview")

Click now on the *Save* button to generate the PDF for the result report. After
the report was created, the system redirects you to the analysis reports listing
of the client.

![Analysis Reports Listing](/screenshots/client_analysis_reports_listing.png "Analysis Reports Listing")

However, this step was not sufficient to transition the Sample to the final
*Published* state (note the blue border of the referenced sample). To achieve
this, the report needs to get either send via email to the noted Contacts of the
Sample or it need to get force published by a user with the `Lab Manager` role.

Selecting the report will therefore display these two options to proceed.

![Analysis Reports Listing](/screenshots/client_analysis_reports_listing_publish.png "Analysis Reports Listing")

Please click on the *Email* button to open the Email form for this analysis report.

![Email Analysis Report](/screenshots/client_analysis_report_email.png "Email Analysis Report")

Since we did not add a valid email address for our selected Client Contact, the
system shows an error message when we try to send the email.

![Email Analysis Report](/screenshots/client_analysis_report_email_failed.png "Email Analysis Report")

Luckily, this can be fixed by simply adding an email address to our Client
Contact. Navigate to the *Contacts* tab of the *Happy Hills* client and select
the *Edit* tab for *Rita Mohale*.

![Edit Client Contact](/screenshots/client_contact_edit.png "Edit Client Contact")

Click on the *Save* button when you are done and navigate back to the *Analysis
Reports* listing, where you select the generated report and press the *Email*
button.

Now the system should allow to send the email, which will transition the Sample
into the *Publish* state.

![Analysis Reports Listing](/screenshots/client_analysis_reports_listing_2.png "Analysis Reports Listing")

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
Although the system failed to send the email because we neither configured the
email settings of SENAITE, not entered a valid email address, it still
transitions the sample to the *Published* state.
This behavior is by purpose, because we actually cannot control email delivery
and the publication step should not depend on that.

![Sample Published](/screenshots/sample_published.png "Sample Published")

Congratulations üôå you successfully published your first Sample in SENAITE.
