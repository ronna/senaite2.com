Worksheets provide some powerful tools for Quality Control and Quality Assurance
(QA/QC) based on *Reference Samples*. They can assure that the Instruments 
measured correctly and mitigate human mistakes when carrying over the results 
into SENAITE. Besides, the person in charge of verifying results during the 
verification process makes use of them to guarantee that the tests have been 
performed in accordance with the SOPs and results are valid.

## Preparing the LIMS

Blank and Control References can be both added in a Supplier.

Navigate to the *LIMS Setup* by clicking the ‚öôÔ∏è button in the upper right corner
and then on the *Suppliers* tile.

Click on the ‚äï Add Button to create a new Supplier.

![Add Supplier](/screenshots/add_supplier_screen_default.png "Add Supplier")

Enter the following values in the add form:

- Name: `Reference Samples LLC.`

Press the *Save* button when you are done.


## Blank Reference

Blank References are Samples where all values (e.g. concentration of a given
substance or component) are zero or 'blank'.

Navigate to the previously created *Supplier* and select then the *Reference
Samples* tab.

![Add Reference Sample](/screenshots/supplier_reference_samples_listing.png "Add Reference Sample")

Click on the ‚äï Add Button to create a new Reference Sample.

![Add Reference Sample](/screenshots/add_reference_sample_screen_default.png "Add Referene Sample")
![Add Reference Sample](/screenshots/add_reference_sample_screen_dates.png "Add Reference Sample")
![Add Reference Sample](/screenshots/add_reference_sample_screen_references.png "Add Reference Sample")

Enter the following values in the add form:

- Title: `Distilled Water`
- Blank: Activate the checkbox
- Expiry Date: 2039-12-01 (or any other date in the future)
- Reference Values: Set an *Expected Result* of `0` for all Analyses

Press the *Save* button when you are done.

Navigate now back to the previously create *Worksheet* and click on the *Add Blank Reference* tab.

![Add Blank Reference](/screenshots/worksheet_add_blank_reference.png "Add Blank Reference")

When adding a Blank Reference to a Worksheet, the blank reference values that
match with the Analyses in the Worksheet are always preselected, like in that
case the `Salmonella`.

However, it is also possible to add the other provided reference values of the
Blank to the Worksheet.

We continue with just the already selected reference value and press the *Add* button.

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
There is currently a bug in SENAITE Core that you cannot add a reference sample
when the Worksheet is in a non-open state, e.g. like in this case *To be verified*.
To workaround this bug you can either create a new Worksheet or retract one of
the analysis results, so that the worksheet rolls back to the state *Open*. The
latter option is used in the following example.

![Worksheet Results](/screenshots/worksheet_results_with_blank.png "Worksheet Results")

Log in with the `analyst1` account to add the results.

![Worksheet Results](/screenshots/worksheet_analyst_results_with_blank.png "Worksheet Results")

In this case everything is correct and the Analyst neither found any
`Salmonella` in the Water sample, nor in the Blank Reference Sample.

Consequently, having a correct Blank Reference Result tells us that the used
instrument of the Analyst measured correctly. Nevertheless, it does not give any
hint if the Analyst did its job correctly.


## Control Reference

A *Control Reference* is similar to the previous *Blank Reference*, but with the
difference, that the values are non `0` or 'blank'.

Navigate to the previously created *Supplier* and select then the *Reference
Samples* tab and click on the ‚äï Add Button to create a new Reference Sample.

Enter the following values in the add form:

- Title: `Water Reference`
- Blank: Deactivate the checkbox
- Expiry Date: 2039-12-01 (or any other date in the future)
- Reference Values:
  - `Calcium`:
    - Expected Result: `5`
    - Permitted Error: `5`
  - `Magnesium`:
    - Expected Result: `5`
    - Permitted Error: `5`
  - `Total Hardness`:
    - Expected Result: `10`
    - Permitted Error: `5`

Press the *Save* button when you are done.

Navigate back to the Worksheets listing and add a new *Worksheet* for `analyst1`
and assign from one of the previous Samples the Analyses `Calcium`, `Magnesium`
and `Total Hardness`. Chose the *Classic* layout.

![Worksheet Results](/screenshots/worksheet_manage_results.png "Worksheet Results")

Navigate now to the *Add Control Reference* tab.

![Add Control Reference](/screenshots/worksheet_add_control_reference.png "Add Control Reference")

This time all the values from the *Control Reference* are selected, because we
have exactly these Analyses in our Worksheet.

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
There is currently a bug in SENAITE Core that you cannot add a control references for
Calculated Analyses. Therefore, we ignore for now the missing value for `Total Hardness`.

![Worksheet Results](/screenshots/worksheet_analyst_results_with_control.png "Worksheet Results")

In this case everything is correct and the measured results for `Calcium` and
`Magnesium` are in the permitted error percentage of `[4.75;5.25]`.

Consequently, having a correct Control Reference Result tells us again that the
used instrument of the Analyst measured correctly, but there is still no hint if
the Analyst carried over the numbers correctly.


## Duplicates

Every Sample of a Worksheet can be duplicated with all of the contained Analyses.

Navigate now back to the previously created *Worksheet* and click on the *Add
Duplicate* tab. Please also ensure that the Worksheet is in the open state,
because it is otherwise not possible to add the Duplicate.

![Add Duplicate](/screenshots/worksheet_add_duplicate.png "Add Duplicate")

All the Analyses from the Sample are now duplicated for this Worksheet and any
deviation between the actual results and the duplicate will be alerted.

![Worksheet Results](/screenshots/worksheet_analyst_results_with_duplicate.png "Worksheet Results")

In this case the Analyst entered different results for the `Calcium` and
`Magnesium` Analyses of the Duplicate, which got marked with an exclamation
mark.

Consequently, the Analyst did either measured incorrectly or had an carry over
mistake.

**‚òùÔ∏èNote:**
By default, the duplication variation percentage is set to 0 %. This means that
an alert will be displayed if the results of duplicate analyses carried out on
the same sample differ, even if the difference is small. You can change the
duplication variation percentage in "Analysis Service" edit view, under 
"Method" tab.


Congratulations üôå you successfully learned how to add reference Samples to your
Worksheet and how to interprete them.
